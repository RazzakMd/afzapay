=============

The existing processor implementation for Citibank would be a good guide
to start. $JAVA_TOP/oracle/apps/iby/bep/proc/citibank has all the files you
will need. You will need to handle the Online Auth and Offline Batch
operations like capture, return etc as well as acknowledgement parsing from
your procesor. In case your processor needs any fields that are not
available in the Extract XML generated by the iPayment engine, you can use
the customizer interface
($JAVA_TOP/oracle/apps/iby/extend/impl/ProcCus tomizerImplcit.class for
Citibank) to pick up additional fields to be included in the Extend element
of the Extract XML.
